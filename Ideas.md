 - Converting the train stations to coordiantes, so that we can train the model on numerical values instead of categorical ones and avoid the encoding problems. 

 - The predictions will be possible to be performed on train stations that are not necessarily on the training set. (Maybe gaussian processes regression)

 - Taking into account the past month's [actual] delays and the delays on the train stations that are on the way. (sort of Markov chain ?)
